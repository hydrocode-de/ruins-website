            We seek to investigate how different perceptions about uncertainty relate to data and projections about climate change. Furthermore, we extend the data analysis with model projections of exemplary management options in different sectors. These examples are intended to unveil different aspects of uncertainty, which are inherent to the topic of future projections and present decisions.

            In this chapter we provide visualisations to explore changes in observed weather data. As classic starting point, the local implication of global warming can be explored. We provide further topics like weather indices and drought indices to investigate how climate change manifests itself in different variables, at different stations and with different temporal aggregation.
            As a brief outlook into future projections based on climate models (see next chapter), we also include an aggregated version for the respective weather variables and indices.

            In this chapter we detail the view on climate model projections. If you are new to the topic, please see
            <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work" target="_blank">CarbonBrief</a> for an excellent

            In general, climate models project the state dynamics of the atmosphere under different development paths of
            the concentration of climate relevant gasses like CO<sub>2</sub>. These paths are called RCPs (Relative Concentration Pathways)
            termed as added warming potential. We provide the most commonly used RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. For more details about the meaning of 
            the RCPs please see a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3" target="_blank">Nature Comment</a>.

            A further important clarification has to be made about the scale the climate models operate on. GCMs (Global Climate Models)
            commonly operate at grids which cover approx. 120 km x 120 km in central Europe. Hence, the whole North Sea and the German coast
            fall in one single grid of such models. To provide more spatial details, RCMs (Regional Climate Models) are used to further
            process output from GCMs at a much finer grid of approx. 11 km x 11 km. The climate model data in this app has been calculated
            in a daily timestep.<br />
            We adhere the investigation to the same topics we introduced in chapter 1. Our focus here is to find out how different models
            and different RCPs lead to different projections.
