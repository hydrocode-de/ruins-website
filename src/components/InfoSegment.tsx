            We seek to investigate how different perceptions about uncertainty relate to data and projections about climate change. Furthermore, we extend the data analysis with model projections of exemplary management options in different sectors. These examples are intended to unveil different aspects of uncertainty, which are inherent to the topic of future projections and present decisions.

We provide further topics like weather indices and drought indices to investigate how climate change manifests itself in different variables, at different stations and with different temporal aggregation.
            As a brief outlook into future projections based on climate models (see next chapter), we also include an aggregated version for the respective weather variables and indices.
